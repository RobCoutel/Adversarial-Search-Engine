# Adversarial-Search-Engine
@ authors : COUTELIER Robin and PIRENNE Lize

This is an unfinished project realized by 2 students of the University of Li√®ge.

It consists in a series of adversarial seach methods to play two players, deterministic games.

On top of that, we took advantage of the NeuralNetwork library we developed to test different
training methods such as the gradient descent. For now, the gradient descent is used to
train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database.
Though the results are all right, we are currently trying to make it learn faster
and reach higher accuracy.

The differents approaches to adversarial search are :
 - Minimax algorithm with prunning
 - Budget of exploration of the game tree
The evaluation functions are implemented either with a our knowledge of the game, or by a neural Network.

What works and was tested :
 - The implementations of the game of Chess
 - The implementation of the game of TicTacToe
 - The agents : AgentBudget, AgentMinimaxSorted
 - The tournament management system (though it can still be improved)

What seems to work but still needs to be further testing
 - The matrix library
 - The Neural Network propagation
 - The Neural Network gradient descent learning

What does not work :
 - The genetic algorithm to teach the neural network is also deficient

What will be added soon :
 - The GUI to play chess. Our current version uses Processing 4 to function, but we are seeking a better solution
 - A Monte Carlo tree search algorithm as a new Agent


How does the project work
 - The project works on a bash terminal with java vresion : openjdk 11.0.9 2020-10-20
 - Every command is inputted in the terminal on the directory /Adversarial-Seach-Engine$
 - To compile the files, we use $ ./make.sh
 - To execute the main functions, at the top the file, there is the command line we use with the arguments

The main functions are located in :
 - com.chess.Chess.java             to play a game of chess between agents
 - com.ticTacToe.TicTacToe.java     to play a game of TicTacToe between agents
 - com.neuralNetworks.Genetics.java to train the neural networks of agents (currently not great)
 - DigitRecognition.java            to train the neural network on the mnist_train_small database
